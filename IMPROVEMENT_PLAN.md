# üéØ AutoMapper Analyzer - Comprehensive Improvement Plan

**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: In Progress
**Goal**: Fix package installation, reduce duplication, automate releases, improve structure

---

## üìä Issues Identified

### üö® Critical Issues
- [ ] Package installation not verified (test-install uses ProjectReference, not actual packages)
- [ ] Fragile package structure (manual DLL copying from bin folders)
- [ ] Poor UX (two separate packages instead of one unified package)
- [ ] 60-70% code duplication across 7 CodeFix providers
- [ ] No automated release process (manual publish script)
- [ ] Non-standard versioning (date-based instead of semantic)

---

- [ ] Measure code reduction (target: 60-70% less code)
- [ ] Build and verify all fixes still work
- [ ] Update code documentation

**Status**: Not Started
**Expected Outcome**: 60-70% less code, easier maintenance, consistent patterns

## üìù Notes and Decisions

### 2025-10-02: Initial Plan Creation
- Identified 5 critical issues with package structure and releases
- Created comprehensive 4-phase improvement plan
- Set up tracking system with checkboxes
- Ready to begin Phase 0 completion and Phase 1 execution

### Key Decisions
- **Merge CodeFixes into Analyzers**: Industry standard is one package, better UX
- **Semantic Versioning**: Move from date-based to Major.Minor.Patch
- **Shared Base Classes**: Extract common patterns to reduce duplication
- **Automated Releases**: GitHub Actions with tag-based triggers

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create this improvement plan document
2. Commit improvement plan to git
